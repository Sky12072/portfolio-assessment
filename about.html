            <p class="special-paragraph">It's quite a long journey to get me here in the IT Bootcamp. Firstly, a little
                of my background. I enjoyed playing musical
                instruments and this has led me to come to Australia to study music further then followed by both study
                and work in business
                and health sectors such as pharmacy and dental sector. However, interestingly I also ended up working in
                the finance sector before deciding to study IT.</p>
            <p class="special-paragraph">I have started studying programming back in July 2021 at TAFE, but despite
                that, it was quite tough for me as a
                beginner and there was not enough support system while learning to code. Luckily, a new friend
                recommended me Coder Academy's Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p class="special-paragraph">My plan is to delve into IT for the next decades if possible, starting with web
                development and once I gained some work experience
                I'd like to learn further and hopefully be able to specialise in a higher skill within the IT industry.

                As the world moves into the future, coding will only become more important. Hence, I'm dedicating myself to make continuous improvement and here are some of the coding projects I have involved for the year 2022:

            <p>
                I plan to continue working on my coding skills and creating new coding projects. I am interested in coding projects that help people to communicate and share information and make people's lives more fun and easier in this already challenging life. I also want to continue to learn new coding languages and create coding projects that are helpful and informative. In the year 2022, I hope to continue to improve my coding skills and create coding projects that are useful and interesting. Thank you for reading!

                In this hackathon coordinated by my campus - Coder Academy, in teams of 3 we created a game app called Poke EDU. Poke EDU is Tim, Chris, and Rob's Coder Academy hackathon submission. It is simple 'educational' pokemon game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Gameplay involves navigating a user selected character avatar though a 2D map that has randomly selected Pokemon positioned throughout. To pass each level, the player is required to successfully complete a quiz for each Pokemon on the map.
